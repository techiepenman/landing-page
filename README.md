# Landing Page

## Overview
 In this project all the menu items in the navbar are being populated dynamically based on the sections in the html file. All is done through manipulation of the DOM with JavaScript.
 
 
 The Scroll effect and active classes are also done with JavaScript.
 While browsing the page, viewport is being observed to update the navbar item corresponding to the section in viewport.
 
 
 The structure html and styling are provided by Udacity as part of the Nanodegree Front End Web Developer program.
