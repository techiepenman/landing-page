# Landing Page

## About the project
 In this project all the menu items in the navbar are being populated dynamically based on the sections in the html file. All is done through manipulation of the DOM with JavaScript.
 The Scroll effect and active classes are also done with JavaScript.
 The structure html and styling are provided by Udacity as part of the Nanodegree Front End Web Developer program.
